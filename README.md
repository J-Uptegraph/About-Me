# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Johnathan Uptegraph** — a Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for building systems that move, think, and scale.

Over the past two years, I’ve deployed **50+ industrial robots**, programming and integrating with KUKA, Fanuc, ABB, and Yaskawa robots. While I’ve developed expertise in **PLC programming** (Rockwell, Siemens), I also love **robotics R&D**, **3D printing**, and **mechatronics** — in my spare time I enjoy designing systems that blend hardware, software, and creativity.

### ⚙️ What I Do
- Full-cell robotic integration (KUKA, ABB, Fanuc)
- PLC + HMI development (ladder logic, structured text)
- Embedded systems & prototyping (ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
- CAD & 3D modeling (Fusion 360, Blender, Maya)
- Front-end development (HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, React)
- UX/UI design & product storytelling
- Game dev & simulation (Unity, Unreal, P5.js)
