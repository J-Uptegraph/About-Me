# Johnathan Uptegraph
**Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer**  
*"I build systems that thrive under pressure—and scale with purpose."*

I’m a robotics engineer dedicated to crafting human-centered systems that blend precision engineering with innovative design. With a proven track record of deploying 50+ industrial robots (KUKA, Fanuc, ABB) and reverse-engineering $25M+ systems, I thrive in high-stakes automation challenges. Now, I’m focused on **robotics R&D**, specializing in mechatronics, rapid prototyping, and complex system design for humanoid and assistive robots.

My personal project, **CORI (Co-Operative Organizational Robotic Intelligence)**—a home-assistant robot for laundry and household tasks, showcasing my ability to merge technical expertise with creative problem-solving. I’m also writing *Software Patch*, a narrative weaving robotics, control theory, and personal resilience. Outside the lab, you’ll find me boxing, lifting weights, or diving into the latest comics.
