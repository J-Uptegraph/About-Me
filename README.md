### Welcome 👋

My name is Johnathan Uptegraph, and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Emerging Technology in Business and Design. ETBD combines technology, business, and design with the technical aspects of data science, engineering, and programming. The skills obtained from ETBD have allowed me to create various structured digital environments that enable users to interact with data for appropriate purposes and develop innovative interactive digital solutions with real-world applications. In addition to ETBD, I'm also currently pursuing minors in Computer Science and Games + Simulations.

My academic interests include 3D printing, robotics, computer programming, front-end/back-end web development, electronic hardware, UX/UI design, VR, AR, and game development. Over the last few years, I have gained various levels of experience in several programming languages, including, but not limited to, Java, C, C#, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. These experiences have taught me how to apply my technical programming knowledge to practical digital solutions through problem-based learning and team-oriented projects.

I have also had the good fortune to work with a wide variety of digital tools. I have experience with several types of CAD modeling software, including Autodesk Fusion 360, Blender, and PrusaSlicer. In addition to several members of the Adobe Creative Cloud Platform. I have focused my game development efforts on working in Unity and scripting in C#.

I have mainly focused on expanding my hardware knowledge outside of the classroom through personal projects using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, allowing me to consistently practice and improve my soldering skills. I have also expanded my general hardware knowledge by maintaining and upgrading my 3D Printer.

Lastly, I have received multiple awards for "Outstanding Customer Service." I'm great at planning activities, breaking down concepts, and effectively communicating them to a team. I am a hands-on person that loves to be a part of the creative process, and I look forward to the possibility of working together soon.
