**Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer**  
***"I build systems that thrive under pressure‚Äîand scale with purpose."***

I see robotics as both a **science and an art**‚Äîwhere **engineering meets creative problem-solving**. I think like an **engineer** and develop like a **designer**, creating systems that **perform under pressure** and **are designed to scale with purpose**. With over **two years of experience** deploying **50+ robots** across **$25M+ installations** in **EV, medical, and defense sectors**, I specialize in solutions that **launch fast, scale efficiently, and adapt to real-world constraints**.

From **full-cell deployments** to **embedded prototypes** using **Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and Arduino**, I **bridge concept to execution**. I‚Äôve **optimized motion paths**, **reverse-engineered undocumented PLC logic**, and delivered **reliable systems that keep production moving**. I‚Äôve also prototyped **assistive technology** for individuals with cerebral palsy, developing **sensor-driven, user-friendly systems** in collaboration with **university research teams**.

Now, I‚Äôm channeling that expertise into **robotics R&D, mechatronics, rapid prototyping, and complex system design for humanoid and assistive robots**. In my spare time, I‚Äôm developing **CORI (Co-Operative Organizational Robotic Intelligence)**, a **home-assistant robot for laundry and household tasks** using **ROS2 & Gazebo**. I‚Äôm also writing *Software Patch*, a **personal resilience narrative** that uses the **language and logic of computing** to articulate and process the **intricacies of human experience**, offering a **unique perspective on personal growth, overcoming adversity, and finding meaning in a complex world**.

Outside the lab, I enjoy **boxing, weightlifting, and catching up on the latest comics**.
