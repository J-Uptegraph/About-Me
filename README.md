**Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer**  
Building systems that move, adapt, and inspire.

I’m a robotics engineer dedicated to crafting human-centered systems that blend precision engineering with innovative design. With a proven track record of deploying 50+ industrial robots (KUKA, Fanuc, ABB) and reverse-engineering $25M+ systems, I thrive in high-stakes automation challenges. Now, I’m advancing **robotics R&D**, specializing in mechatronics for humanoid and assistive robots.

My side project, **CORI (Co-Operative Organizational Robotic Intelligence)**—a home-assistant robot for laundry and household tasks—showcases my ability to merge technical expertise with creative problem-solving. I’m also writing *Software Patch*, a narrative weaving robotics, control theory, and personal resilience. Outside the lab, I’m boxing, lifting weights, or diving into the latest comics.
