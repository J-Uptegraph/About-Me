### Welcome 

I am a recent graduate from Miami University with a bachelor's degree in Emerging Technology in Business and Design (ETBD) and minors in Computer Science and Games & Simulations. My ETBD program has provided me with a strong foundation in technology, business, and design, as well as a deep understanding of data science, engineering, and programming.

Throughout my education, I have had the opportunity to explore various disciplines, including 3D printing, robotics, computer programming, front-end and back-end web development, electronic hardware, UX/UI design, VR, AR, and game development. I have developed my skills through problem-based learning and team-oriented projects, learning to apply my technical programming knowledge to practical digital solutions.

I have experience as the Robotics Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at Miami University, where I have experience working with Vector, Furhat, and Pepper robots, and managing the maintenance and programming of electronic hardware devices. My expertise includes Objective-C, python, C#, and .NET, and Git. Additionally, I have experience as a Web Development Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, with skills in iOS, Software Development, Web Design, Web Development, SwiftUI, Xcode, Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and Git.

I have also had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects such as participating on Walt Disney World Invention & Innovation Program, developing prototypes for immersive experiences using Disney's technology, researching entertainment design principles and helping on a Dysphagia Robotics Research Project. I'm also currently working as a Developer and UI Designer for a game called "Pith" built with Unreal Engine 4 and have done UI/UX research for the Special Olympics Website and Graeter's Ice Cream mobile app.

I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skillset and I'm available for collaboration opportunities and open to new job offers. Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or GitHub.
